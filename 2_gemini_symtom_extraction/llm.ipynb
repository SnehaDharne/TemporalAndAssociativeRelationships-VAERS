He looked at his shoulder and his shoulder was on bone.  His flesh and muscle has all eroded from his right arm.  It is moving to his right leg and to his left side.  He has been to numerous physicians who told him that he has had no problems.  He has been going to the doctor nonstop and taking steps for about 10 months, and he says that it is slowly taking away his flesh.  The best way to describe it is his body is slowly eating itself asymmetrical from right to left.  He has been to a neurologist, Rheumatologist, Oncologist, Nephrologist who have not found anything in regard to  what is going on.  Has been to 30+ doctors, and has had blood work, MRI's and muscle tests and they cannot find anything wrong with him.  They do not recognize it as they have not seen him in the past, but he is loosing strength in his right side and is right handed dominent and his left arm is now stronger than his right now.  He has had his eyes on it for the last 10 months and has slowly seen his body eat itself.  He had a nerve conduction study done the other day that did not show any problems with his muscles.  He feels that there is something is going on, and he can see the radius in his arm and veins in his arm that he could not see a year ago and feels that his body is slowly dying.  He is a healthy 50 year old guy and feels that in a year or so he will be noticed and then it will be too late to do anything for him.  The doctors have not given any diagnosis or any answers to his problem.    He noticed it first with his wrist and then he felt his bones and then felt his shoulder and said it's just like bone, muscle and tendon's.  Tomorrow he is having a CAT scan of his pancreas to see if there is something to do with that.  The worst spot is his right shoulder, right arm and felt that he may have had ALS and they tell him that his muscles are fine, but he said that if he had to lift weights that he would not be able to and his strength is slowly eroding in his entire body.  He says that the connective flesh is gone.  He was informed that they felt that he has anxiety, but all the doctors are making him feel like he is making up things.  He never went to the doctor in the past as he was healthy and he feels that they feel he is making things up.    If he goes to the ER they tell him that there is no emergency.  He has been sent away from the ER a  couple of times as they send him away.  His blood work is all OK.  Says that his arm looks like somebody took a chunk out of his arm.  His left arm is now doing the same thing but slower.   He is starting to get pain in his right shoulder and right wrist area as the connecting flesh is eroding away and has not experienced this pain before.  These are the two weakest areas on his body.    By the time he had the 4th vaccine his symptoms were full blown and he says that his arm is slowly deconstructing itself, and his arm is literally caving in.
