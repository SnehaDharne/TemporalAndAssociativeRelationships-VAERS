At the time of the report, CAROTID ARTERY DISSECTION (Cerebral artery dissection) had resolved and COVID-19 (COVID-19) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-May-2022, Polymerase chain reaction: (Positive) for a non-Omicron variant but was asymptomatic   at the time. In May 2022, Arteriogram carotid: non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography was conducted, which showed a focal dissection with luminal irregularity, an   intimal flap, and moderate to severe luminal stenosis of the distal right cervical internal carotid artery and right petrous internal carotid junction. In May 2022, Blood glucose: normal. In May 2022, Blood iron: normal. In May 2022, Serum ferritin: normal. In May 2022, Ultrasound Doppler: Of the cervical carotid arteries revealed no significant occlusive disease of the common and internal arteries. Maximum velocities in the right common carotid artery and the right internal carotid artery were 105/26 cm/s and 66/20 cm/s,   respectively. Maximum velocity was 116/23 cm/s in the left common carotid artery and 109/18 cm/s in the left internal carotid artery. Both the right and left vertebral arteries had normal antegrade flow. The subclavian artery had normal multiphasic flow.

In April 2022, she was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and tested positive on May 9, 2022, for a non-Omicron variant but was asymptomatic. Despite full vaccination and two boosters with mRNA-1273, she developed a severe headache on May 10, 2022, accompanied by right-ear pulsatile tinnitus and vertigo. Her symptoms worsened, leading to an emergency department visit on May 19, 2022, where she was prescribed azithromycin for a presumptive ear infection, which did not resolve her symptoms. On May 26, 2022, a carotid bruit was detected, and subsequent imaging revealed a focal dissection with luminal irregularity and stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. She was prescribed clopidogrel and aspirin and underwent a diagnostic angiogram on June 7, 2022, confirming a complex dissection with 70% stenosis and a pseudoaneurysm.

My husband, an overall healthy 69 year old, fit, received his 7th covid shot on October 3rd. 2023 (No flu vaccine on that day). He received Moderna, most of his prior ones had been Pfizer. Around the same time he had a confirmed deer tic bite while hiking in the area, that was discovered by his dermatologist, still attached, a couple of days later.  He was prescribed a one day large dose of Doxycycline, 8 tabs in 1 day, in addition to Amoxicillin he was taking for a tooth implant.    His WBC were in normal range, 6.2, in July 2023, done for a physical exam. On October 16 he had bloodwork done for a prep op, for planned hip replacement, and it was found that his WBC were low at 1.9, mostly at the expense of neutrophils that were low at 12% Repeated on October 18 for a planned trip, it had gone up slightly to 2,3 and we decided to travel for a family visit.    On arrival he had fever, was seen by a PCP there and determined his WBC were 0.7 on October 20, he had a, likely opportunistic, rectal abscess and diverticulitis.  He was hospitalized, treated with Neupogen for stimulation of bone marrow and responded very well. WBC normalized in a couple of days.   He was discharged after 5 days with a basically normal count, no fever and otherwise healthy.    WBCs have remained normal since then.   Hematologists and other doctors he has seen remain split regarding possible cause of his drop in WBCs, neutrophils mostly. It does not seem he acquired Lyme disease.  Some doctors believe it was caused by doxycycline, though I do not see any reports about it, others believe it was the vaccine, which I know can cause transient benign low WBCs.  Others blame the tic but it would have been to soon to cause a drop like that 12 days after the bite and with treatment.    Any thoughts? Should he avoid covid vaccine in the future or switch to Novavax? Or Pfizer mRNA? Are there any similar reports with mRNA vaccines or with doxycycline?   Thank you for your help, if needed I have all his labs and medical history. I attach a list of his meds but none was a recent change and he has continued them.

I also started having difficulty running and climbing stairs.  After getting an MRI a few weeks later, and followed up with a Spinal Tap, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  At the time I was taking an immunosuppressant Azathioprine that my neurologist said could treat MS so he didn't change my treatment at that time.  The symptoms went away on their own in another month or so, don't remember exactly how long it lasted.  I received another Moderna COVID booster a few months later on 5/17/22 (same location, lot 056A22A).  A couple weeks after that, I had another relapse in early June with tightness in my left hip.  At that point I had switched neurologists to an MS specialist and they recommend I and get Steroids to treat the current relapse and change to a stronger medication, Tysabri, since it seemed to be worsening.  I did 3 days of Steroid IVs which got rid of the new symptoms, and then started monthly Tysabri infusion in August 2022. I am currently without severe symptoms most of the time but regularly throughout the day get some numbness or other pseudo-relapse symptoms, especially when I'm hot or stressed or tired.  Most recent MRIs show the same lesions existing but not new progression.  As a note, I had Optic Neuritis about 10 years before this event - believed by my doctor to be brought on by the medication Humira - and I was told at that time I had a risk of developing MS in the future.","numbness, multiple sclerosis"

So, anyway my doctor prescribed Paxlovid from Pfizer for me and I got it today, well, yesterday and I took it at 3 PM and then I just took it now at 3 AM and I am looking at these pills, the pills that they gave me, these pills are already expired. The box and the pills are labelled that they expired Sep2023. Are these pills good because they have given to me because I am older and I have diabetes and I had a heart operation and so these are supposed to be good to help me recover from COVID. It's a blister pack with the 3 pills for the morning, 3 pills for the 12 hours later. Covid vaccine details: Consumer stated, ""I don't have it handy but my most recent shot because all I have gotten almost 3 years ago. I only use Pfizer. All my shots were at that drug store either that location or one mile away but I had them at withheld so they are all on records there. I have not had any at my doctor's office at all. Consumer stated, I usually only have my shots on the left arm.

When confirmed if had the issues of heart after or before taking the COVID vaccine: Consumer stated, Well, I can tell you the truth, I don't remember having any problems and after the first COVID shot and then I guess, you waited a month or something and you have a second shot. After those two shots, I didn't feel so great. I went to the doctor and they did an EKG and it came out abnormal and they had me go every month for four months in a row, they did an EKG in the office and puts it out abnormal and after that they gave me a CAT scan and they send, a 'needle' sent through my heart over the arteries or whatever we call it and when they put me to sleep, they woke me up for 50 minutes and they said we couldn't do this needle operation, 3 of your arteries are blocked like almost the 100 percent and just before that I was in the hospital over night for something else and they gave me CAT scan, echocardiogram, they checked my carotid arteries, everything was completely falling, no anything and that was an year prior. So, all this with my heart happened after I got the first two COVID shots. Lab work (With in 2 weeks): Consumer stated, No. I take that new injection Mounjaro for diabetes, 7.5 milligrams and it is like a little epipen, it is one shot a week. Treatment: Consumer stated, ""Well, I haven't had ever since the operation 3 years ago, I have no problem with my heart at all and my diabetes, now as I am using the Mounjaro injection there for probably for 6 months now and my blood sugar became normal like A1C is perfect and I lost 50 pounds (further clarifications unknown).""

The patients received vaccination with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s (dose number in series-1) (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number was not reported) dose, start therapy date were not reported for covid-19 prophylaxis. Non-company suspect vaccine included: tozinameran (form of admin, route of admin, and batch number were not reported) dose, start therapy date were not reported for covid-19 prophylaxis and elasomeran (form of admin, route of admin, and batch number were not reported) dose, start therapy date were not reported for covid-19 prophylaxis. No concomitant medications were reported. On an unspecified date, following vaccination with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s, the patients experienced posterior scleritis  (dose number in series 1). Out of 8 patients, only one patient received Johnson and Johnson vaccine, 5 patients received Pfizer and 1 patient received Moderna. 3 patients got affected left eye and 5 patients got affected right eye. Systemic symptoms post-vaccine were reported as 3 patients had Flu-like symptoms, 1 patient had Inflammatory symptoms in other organs. There was growing evidence that COVID-19 infection causes dysregulation of the immune system and has been linked to several systemic autoimmune conditions, particularly vasculitis and inflammatory arthritis. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis have also all been linked to COVID-19 infection. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 infection, particularly anterior segment complications, are relatively common.COVID19 vaccination has been linked to autoimmune ocular complications but data from population-based pharmacovigilance surveillance systems suggest that the prevalence of vaccination-associated ocular adverse events are rare. A meta-analysis of 2,347 confirmed COVID-19 infection cases showed that 11% of infected patients displayed ocular surface manifestations. Ocular pain (31%), discharge (19%), redness (11%), and follicular conjunctivitis (8%) were the main findings, and COVID-19 RNA was detected in 4% of ocular specimens from these patients. Posterior segment manifestations of infection, based on case reports alone, mainly relate to the pro-thrombotic state that can arise from COVID-19 infection and manifest with retinal vascular occlusion, acute macular neuroretinopathy, and paracentral acute middle maculopathy. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of COVID-19 infection include isolated cranial nerve palsies, Miller Fisher syndrome, nystagmus, and saccadic intrusions in association with either brainstem infarction or haemorrhagic acute necrotising encephalopathy. There are several case reports of episcleritis, anterior scleritis, and uveitis associated with COVID-19 infection, but no reported cases or series of posterior scleritis, as we document. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Lab test revealed a super nasal choroidal effusion with ""high water mark"" and multiple hyper auto fluorescent choroidal folds, choroidal effusion infer nasally with a ""high water mark"" posteriorly suggesting partial resolution of fluid, Optical coherence tomography (vertical cut through fovea), intraretinal and shallow subretinal fluid with prominent choroidal folds were observed; and Ultrasonography Discrete scleral nodularity was identified in 4 (50%) subjects, with medium (n = 2, 25%) or high (n = 2, 25%) internal echogenicity, mean thickness of 2.4 mm (median 1.9 mm, range 1.93.3 mm), and dome-shaped (n = 4, 50%) with a base to maximum elevation ratio less than 7:1 and thickened choroidal detachment with episcleral Tenon's oedema (asterisk), suggestive of scleritis and at 4 weeks later, ultrasonography showed near-complete resolution of choroidal effusion and Tenon's oedema, confirmed the choroidal effusion at 2.6 mm in thickness and with minimal scleritis-related Tenon's oedema (occlumency). The main limitation of this study is our inability to prove a causal link between vaccination against COVID-19 and/or COVID-19 infection and posterior scleritis. It was, however, the most obvious variable relative to the scleritis. A previous study on etiology of choroidal pseudo melanoma identified posterior scleritis in a few cases [7]. Another limitation is that two of our patients were lost to follow-up, likely returning to their local ophthalmologist as we reassured them of the lack of melanoma. Loss to follow-up is anticipated, especially in this condition which can resolve spontaneously over time and can be managed locally. In summary, we documented 8 cases of COVID-19-related posterior scleritis simulating uveal melanoma that followed vaccination and/or infection by the virus. With conservative management, the inflammation tended to be self-limiting with resolution over 2 months and with minimal visual consequences. RESULTS: Previous COVID-19 vaccination was documented in 6 patients (75%) and previous COVID-19 infection and vaccination in 2 patients (25%). Demographic features included mean age of 59 years (median 68, range 586 years), race (n = 7, 87%), and male sex (n = 5, 63%). Mean visual acuity at presentation was 0.24 Log MAR (median 0.18, range 0.00.70). The main presenting symptom was blurred vision with pain (n = 5, 63%). Features that suggested scleritis and not uveal melanoma included pain (n = 6, 75%), anterior scleritis (n = 3, 38%), disc oedema (n = 1, 13%), choroidal detachment (n = 3, 38%), choroidal folds (n = 3, 38%), diffusely thickened scleral wall on ultrasonography (n = 2, 25%), Tenon's oedema (n = 5, 63%), and scleral nodule with medium/high internal reflectivity on ultrasonography (n = 4, 50%). Follow-up information at mean of 2 months (range 0.257 months) revealed visual acuity at date last seen was mean 0.30 log MAR (median 0.29, range 0.00.54). By 2 months, resolution of ""tumor"" was noted in 5/6 (83%) patients with follow-up.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s, tozinameran, and elasomeran was not applicable. The outcome of the posterior scleritis  was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior scleritis following COVID-19 vaccination and/or infection can masquerade as choroidal melanoma. At 2 months duration, partial or complete resolution of features with minimal visual consequence was noted. The reporter considered the causality between covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s, and posterior scleritis as related. The reporter did not provide a causality assessment between tozinameran, and posterior scleritis, and between elasomeran, and posterior scleritis. Company causality between covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s, and posterior scleritis was not related. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender's Comments: V0 This report concerns a patient of unspecified age and gender who experienced a posterior scleritis, unspecified duration after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. There is a limited information regarding latency, clinical findings pertaining to this patient , medical history and associated risk factors. Based on the information available, a reasonable possibility to suggest a causal relationship between covid vaccine and the event posterior scleritis cannot be established. Hence, the causality is assessed not related at this time. Further details requested.",covid-19
